 Create a class named `Dog` that‚Ä¶

 Add a second (non-required) initializer to `Dog` that takes both the `name` and `numTricksLearned` as parameters. Then call this initializer from the required initializer.

 Add a convenience initializer to `Dog` that defaults the dog's name to your favorite dog's name, with however many tricks the dog has learned.
